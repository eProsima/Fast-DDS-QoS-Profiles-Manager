# Fast DDS QoS Profiles Manager CLI

This project implements the Fast DDS QoS Profiles Manager Command-Line Interface (CLI) to easily interact with the [Fast DDS QoS Profiles Manager library](../lib/README.md).

<!-- TODO: The following information should be moved to the documentation project once it is created -->

## Dependencies

*eProsima Fast DDS QoS Profiles Manager CLI* depends on the [*eProsima Fast DDS QoS Profiles Manager Library*](../lib/README.md) and [docopt](http://docopt.org/).
In order to build the first dependency, follow the instructions provided in the project's README.
The second dependency can be installed in Ubuntu with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install libdocopt-dev
```

## Build

<!-- TODO: installation instructions should be in the documentation.
           A reference to the documentation is enough here in the README -->

The CLI can be built either using colcon or CMake directly.
